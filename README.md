<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Ohio Bones, a young detective, hears strange rumors about the Computer Museum. It is said that something unusual is happening there. Some claim to see things moving on their own, others talk about disappearing visitors and old objects that seem to activate in strange ways. 
An inexplicable curiosity leads Ohio to the decision to visit it and shed light on the unsolved mysteries of the museum. Entering the museum, he sees old technology devices (computers, game consoles and other items from the past).
His goal is to solve the puzzles, collect items inside the museum and fight an unexpected enemy on an unexpected world. 
Will he be able to find the solution?

Our project is a Virtual Reallity experience that mixes ideas from escape rooms and defeating opponents concepts. 
The inspiration for aeshtetics comes from a variety of games such as Zelda (ping pong style mechanic), Digimon and Fallout Franchise. Î‘ space with a sense of mystery and a room with mechanical objects were required for this result.
